## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do **NOT** file Sonatype support tickets related to __FILL ME IN___
* **DO** file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:
